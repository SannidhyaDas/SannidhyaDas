Iâ€™m an M.Sc. Data Science student with a strong foundation in Statistics, passionate about building intelligent systems that create real impact. With hands-on experience in ML, DL, and Generative AI, I love writing clean codeâ€”and more importantly, explaining it in a way that makes sense to others.

I specialize in:

1. Predictive Modeling & ML Pipelines

2. Multimodal Systems (Text, Image, Audio)

3. LLMs, RAG, and GenAI Applications

Skilled in Python, R, SQL, with expertise in Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Hugging Face Transformers, and tools like Whisper and CLIP. My academic journey in Statistics helped me master complex analytical concepts and apply them in real-world ML workflows.
Currently building projects that blend theory with practiceâ€”transforming raw data into strategic insights. I thrive on learning, teaching, and collaborating with teams that push the boundaries of AI.

Letâ€™s build something intelligent together.
